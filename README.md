### Step 1 (Right Now): Get Tailwind Working

Check this structure:

```bash
src/
  └── App.jsx
  └── index.css
```

Now, inside `index.css`, make sure you’ve got:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then, inside `tailwind.config.js` (after you init), make sure it includes:

```js
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
```

Once that’s done, start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you see Tailwind styles working (try `class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600"` in `App.jsx`), WE MOVE. 🛩️
