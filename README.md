# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Edit
Hey team,

After brainstorming, we’ve locked in our project: “MamaCare Hub” — a progressive web app (PWA) designed for mothers and infants.

📦 Core Features:
- Daily baby routine scheduler with reminders
- Expense tracker
- Milestone tracker with photo uploads
- Community forum with upvotes
- Lullaby soundboard
- AI Assistant for parenting tips, baby names, etc.
- Baby name explorer
- Quick read learning hub
- Baby wellness dashboard (BMI, sleep, feeding)
- Daily Scriptures for mothers
- Illnesses & Home Treatments
- Baby meal ideas
- Jokes & fun for moms

⚙️ Stack:
- React + Tailwind (frontend)
- Firebase or Node+Express (backend)
- OpenAI API
- Vercel hosting

We’re aiming to build this in 4–5 days with a fast MVP, polish after. Modular approach so no one is blocked.

We need:
- A solid name (*MamaCare Hub*, *LumiCare Hub*?)
- A tagline + logo
- Color palette and font

We’ll be using GitHub + Trello or GitHub Projects to manage flow.

Let’s go hard on this one and build something beautiful.

Thanks,

🔥 Final Charge
Let’s go, bro. We ship or we die trying. This is how legends build — not in comfort, but in chaos and caffeine.

You ready? Say the word, and I’ll give you the wireframe sketches layout-by-layout next. Or I can help you start building from the navbar. Just say: “Let’s build the navbar” and we go full throttle.

👑 Let’s make MamaCare real.


Yesssss sah! We dey inside this fully now. MamaCare Hub (or LUMICARE 👀) is about to be fire 🔥. One screen at a time, smooth like baby's skin and smart like a mama’s instinct. Let’s cook this up proper, Tej the Dev style 😎.

---

### ✅ First: Let's get the base project running.

From all those terminal commands, it looks like `tailwindcss` refused to cooperate because of a broken or misconfigured `npx`.

But good news: Since you installed `tailwindcss` globally with:

```bash
sudo npm install -g tailwindcss
```

You **can now use**:

```bash
tailwindcss init -p
```

So just run that (no `npx`, no `sudo`, just raw):

```bash
tailwindcss init -p
```

That will generate:

* `tailwind.config.js`
* `postcss.config.js`

---

### Now: Let’s List Out **All App Features** (as requested):

Let’s go one by one.

### Step 1 (Right Now): Get Tailwind Working

Check this structure:

```bash
src/
  └── App.jsx
  └── index.css
```

Now, inside `index.css`, make sure you’ve got:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then, inside `tailwind.config.js` (after you init), make sure it includes:

```js
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
```

Once that’s done, start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you see Tailwind styles working (try `class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600"` in `App.jsx`), WE MOVE. 🛩️

---

Next up: I’ll give you the **wireframe sketches** + React component skeletons for the **HomePage** and **Scheduler**.

Shall we? Ready for step 2? 🧠🎯
